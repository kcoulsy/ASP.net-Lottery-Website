# ASP.net-Lottery-Website
A website that allows you to play a lottery. A univeristy project using ASP.net/VB. I got an 81% overall grade for this work. Unfortunately it uses some outdated tech, and finding a reliable host that is free has been a problem.


If you wish to view to site as you would a real site, using Visual Studio you can 'Open a Website Project' then select Home.aspx and click run.
There is a How to run this website pdf and alternatively you can see this google doc file with some screenshots

It's a shame I cannot find a free host that I can use for this project.
